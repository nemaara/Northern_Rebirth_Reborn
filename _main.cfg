Orc clans clash against each other on the surface while Drakes and their Saurian underlings raze the Northlands unchecked. Underneath it all, a mysterious evil works from the shadows to realise their goals. Such is the case, until a boy attempts a daring escape unknowningly aware he is about to set in motion events which might restore the Northlands to its former glory." + _"
